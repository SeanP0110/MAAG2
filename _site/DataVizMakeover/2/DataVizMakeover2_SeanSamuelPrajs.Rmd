# 1 Critique
Prof. Kam has given us the following graph to work on:

![Original Graph](images/OriginalGraph.png)


## 1.1 Clarity

First, let us look at the elements of the graph that are detrimental to clarity.

1. Titles and Subtitles
 + i) Missing Title: The graph is given to us without any context as to what the purpose of the visualisation is. This makes it unclear what to look for in the graph
 + ii) Missing Subtitle: There is no support element to the graph that explains a key insight.
 
2. Axes
 + i) Not synced x-axes: Between the two graphs on the left of the visualisation the hours per day shown on the graphs' x-axes have different tick values. This makes a comparison across the two graphs difficult.
 + ii) Labels: The labels on the y-axis for both of the lefthand-side graphs denote the filtering of the graphs by day type. However, as they are placed right next to the ticks of the y-axis it makes it unclear what the numbers on the y-axes denote.
 
3. Variable names:
 + i) Some of the names and labels of the axes such as "Origin Sz" are unclear. Without further information it is not possible to discern what "Sz" stands for.
 
4. Colouring:
 + i) Adjacency Matrices: While the matrices are coloured according to the percentage of trips of the total table, the difference in colour across the table is not clear as there are too many values.
 
5. Positioning:
 + i) Filters: the filters only change information on the lefthand-side graphs. Therefore it is confusing that they aren placed next to the adjacency matrices instead of the bar charts.
 
## 1.2 Aesthetics

Next, let us discern the issues with the aesthetics of the visualisation:

1. Too large data:
 + i) Adjacency Matrix: the adjacency matrix is too populated with data and therefore not aesthetic to the eyes.
 
2. Positioning:
 + i) Graphs: Graphs are positioned all next to each other. This gives a feeling of cluttering that makes it unaesthetic to look at the visualisation.
 + ii) Adjacency Matrices: Placed above each other and are therefore hard to compare and not pleasing to the eye.

3. Axes:
 + i) Bar Chart y-axis: The two y-axes on the bar charts are separate for weekends and weekdays, since the data is placed on two different axes. This makes it hard to compare the two and, given the small amount of data for weekend trips, there is no possibility to discern useful insights just from graphs showing weekend data.
 
## 1.3 Interactivity

Lastly, in the critique section, we will be examining the flaws in the interactive features of the visualisation.

1. Filters
 + i) Abundance of Options: There are too many options in the filters and it is hard to find specific subzones based on the list.
 + ii) Position: Filters are not positioned next to the filtered data.

2. Adjacency Matrices:
 + i) Abundance of Data: Too many data points visualised at once make it hard to find and hover over a specific origin / destination pair in the matrices.

3. Bar Charts:
 + i) Tooltips: Data is not properly labeled insight the tooltips which makes reading data out of them confusing and unintuitive.

# 2 Improvements

## 2.1 A first sketch
Below you can see the plan for a new and improved visualisation:
![GraphPlan](images/GraphPlan.png)

So how does this improve the abovementioned pain points? Let us find out!
## 2.2 Clarity

1. Titles and Subtitles
 + i) Missing Title: Title to show the objective of the graph
 + ii) Missing Subtitle: Subtitle to provide context over the different types of graphs.
 
2. Axes
 + i) Not synced x-axes: Sync x-axes
 + ii) Labels: Labels around the y-axes to be only information on the values of the y-axes. The weekend/weekday split will be shown in a colour legend.
 
3. Variable names:
 + i) Instead of using abbreviations like "Sz" the full names will be used such as "Subzone"
 
4. Colouring:
 + i) Adjacency Matrices: Colouring will be removed to safeguard the breadth of the data.
 
5. Positioning:
 + i) Filters: Filters will be positioned next to the graphs they filter.
 
## 2.3 Aesthetics

1. Too large data:
 + i) Adjacency Matrix: Include multi-select dropdown menu filters for the adjacency matrices such that user can limit the visualisation to subzones of their interest.
 
2. Positioning:
 + i) Graphs: Only position related graphs next to each other. Have to seperate sections on the dashboard for the bar graphs (on top) and the adjacency matrices (below).
 + ii) Adjacency Matrices: Place adjacency matrices next to each other for easier comparison.

3. Axes:
 + i) Bar Chart y-axis: Place weekend and weekday bars on the same set of axes with a grouped bar chart and discern between them using colours. This will make for an easier comparison between the two.
 
## 2.4 Interactivity

Lastly, how will we remedy some of the interactivity flaws?

1. Filters
 + i) Abundance of Options: Change the filters from lists to dropdown menus.
 + ii) Position: Filters will be placed next to the data they filter.

2. Adjacency Matrices:
 + i) Abundance of Data:
   + a. Increase size of adjacency matrices for easier discernment. 
   + b. Dropdown menu filters to allow user to decrease adjacency matrices only to subzones of interest.

3. Bar Charts:
 + i) Tooltips: Label data properly for facilitated understanding of the graph.

# 5 Key Insights
1. Weekend/Weekday split:
 + At all times of the day the number of bus trips on weekdays is substantially higher than on weekends.
 + A good example would be 18:00 in Admiralty as the destination Subzone. Here there is a more than 9000 public bus trip number difference between weekends and weekdays.

2. Central Timings:
 + More central subzones have a higher amount of bus trips arriving in the morning than in the evening while this trend is opposite for departures where the number is higher in the evening as to the morning.
 + A good example is City Hall Subzone where there are 18 thousand departure trips in the morning hours of 6:00-8:00 versus just under double this number (ca. 34K) betwen 16:00-18:00.
 
3. Total bus trips in Singapore.
 + Overall, Singapore has an enormous number of bus trips every day with alone 7 Million arrivals at subzones in January 2022.
